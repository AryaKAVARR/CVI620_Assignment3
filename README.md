Project title: AI-Powered Artistic Flower Classification and Visualization
Short description: This project aims to develop an AI-based system that integrates 
computer vision techniques and machine learning to classify flower species (e.g., Iris-
setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica) and visualize the results with artistic effects.
1. Video Capture & Image Processing: Leverage techniques from Assignment 1 to
capture real-time video or images of flowers and preprocess them.
2. Artistic Filters: Apply artistic transformations (e.g., watercolor effects) from 
Assignment 2 to enhance the visual representation of flowers.
3. KNN Classification: Implement a K-Nearest Neighbors model to classify 
flowers based on extracted features like petal and sepal dimensions, inspired 
by the KNN model assessment.
4. Visualization: Display classification results with artistic effects on processed 
images, combining art and AI.
